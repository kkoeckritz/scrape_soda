**ScrapeSoda** was created during the 2018 midterms in order to aggregate relevant New York Times political articles. It fetches these via Axios and Cheerio (links to documentation provided below) and assembles snippets of found articles in a clean and simple interface created using good-ole' Bootstrap. Articles can be saved to a library and then annotated. Usage is very straightforward, so give it a try today!
